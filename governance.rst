Governance and Membership
====================================

Founding members
----------------

Open Repair Allianceâ€™s founding members are: Anstiftung Foundation,
Fixit Clinic, iFixit, The Repair Cafe Foundation and The Restart
Project.

All founding members have a strong commitment to repair and to
documenting the challenges and opportunities that we face. Most groups
are non-profit organisations promoting community repair initiatives. The
Alliance also contains a commercial organisation, iFixit, because of its
commitment to sharing repair data as part of the Alliance and for its
active role and strong voice campaigning for repairability in the United
States and in Europe.

The work of the Alliance is facilitated by a coordinator organisation,
The Restart Project, as of November 2017. This role is open to other
members should they wish to participate or collaborate.

Membership
----------

Membership is open to other organisations interested and active in
issues around repair. These include: consumer rights organisations,
environmental NGOs, networks and universities. The rationale for their
involvement is to seek advice, support and insights from groups which
might also benefit from our work.

Decision making
---------------

Decisions on the standard are made through consensus between the core
members.
