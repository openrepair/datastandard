As members of the Open Repair Alliance, organisations are committed to
share data that is accessible, useful and useable for a range of
partners.

To ensure this, organisations are expected to consider that their Open
Repair data is:

-  Create a joint approach to documenting successes and challenges with post-warranty repairs

-  Promote it as a standard available to other community repair networks, and in the future to commercial repairers and others
       collecting repair data

-  Enable coalition members and others to use the data from our joint work to produce insights, with the objective of demanding more
       repairable products, improved support and access to better repair
       services

-  Jointly explore additional information we can all collect to help make a stronger case for increased repairability

-  Structured - data is valid in line with the requirements of the standard

-  Comparable - data can be linked across publishers through codelists and shared references

-  Open - data is appropriately licensed and published

-  Accurate - data is as accurate as possible

-  Timely - data is kept up-to-date and updated regularly
