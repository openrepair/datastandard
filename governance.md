# Governance and Membership

## Founding Members

Open Repair Allianceâ€™s founding members are: Anstiftung Foundation, Fixit Clinic, iFixit, The Repair Cafe Foundation and The Restart Project.
 
All founding members have a strong commitment to repair and to documenting the challenges and opportunities that we face. Most groups are non-profit organisations promoting community repair initiatives. The Alliance also contains a commercial organisation, iFixit, because of its commitment to sharing repair data as part of the Alliance and for its active role and strong voice campaigning for repairability in the United States and in Europe.

The work of the Alliance is facilitated by a coordinator organisation, The Restart Project as of November 2017. The role will rotate between founding members. 

## Additional Membership

Alongside founding members, we will increase membership both via additional core members and via an Advisory Group of other organisations and individuals interested and active in issues around repair. These include: consumer rights organisations, environmental NGOs, networks and universities. The rationale for their involvement is to seek advice, support and insights from groups which might also benefit from our work.  

Additional organisations interested in our work will be able to follow developments and to apply to join the Alliance as core members or in an advisory role. Existing core members will review applications quarterly and accept them unless one or more existing members have objections. 

## Decision Making
Decisions on the standard are made through consensus between the core members.  Any founding members may veto a decision, in the case that discussions do not reach an agreeable consensus. Advisors will share insights and advice, but will not take part in voting.

As the group will grow in the future, we plan to revise decision making by October 2018.
